## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control is where developers are able to keep track of changes made to their code over time, work collaboratively, independently and combine changes made by multiple people.
Github allows for many people to simultaneously work on the same and seperate features of the software and for them to easily store and revert to the history of their changes.
Version control makes it easier to give credit to the responsible person.

## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?
Creating a new repository is easy, all you have to do is go on the Github web page and follow the steps below:
1. In the upper right corner of the Github page, select, then click "New Repository".
2. Type a memorable name for your repository.
3. Choose the repositroy to be publicly visible.
4. Select "Initialise this repository with a README"
5. Click "Create repository".

## Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
The README file explains the purpose of your project, communicates the expectations of the project and attract contributors.
A well written README file should includ the following:
* A brief description of the project
* Installation instructions
* Usage examples
* Contribution guidelines
* Contact information
* Links to additional documentation or related projects
* License information
It makes it easier for contributors to understand the scope of work and the skills needed for contribution. 


## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?

Public repository
Advantages:
* Allow anyone to view, fork and contribute to the code.
* Can attract a community of developers, users and maintainers.
* Proves transparency into the development process.
* They are free to use on Github.

Disadvantages:
* Can lead to unauthorised use or modifications.
* Expose sensitive information, such as API keys and credintials.
* Can attract spam comments, bugs and pull reuqests.

Private repository
Advantages:
* Provide control over who can view and contribute to the code.
* They keep sensitive information confidential.
* Reduce the risks of spam comments and pull requests.

Disadvantages:
* Limit collaboration to invited team members or organisations.
* Require a paid plan to GitHub.
* Make it difficult for others to understand the development process.

## Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?
Commits 
After creating a new repository and adding a file (e.g HTML, CSS JavaScript) to your project yu need to commit that you added the files then selcet "Push to Origin".

## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.

## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?

## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?

## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.

## Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
